## How to get JSON

When you first enter the site, you have two possible inputs. For both of these inputs you can either fetch the data manually or use [The Finals Extractor](https://github.com/Swackles/the-finals-tracker-extractor) to get the data automatically. That project outputs JSON file which you can import here.

## Development

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
